### Summary

In the long term, we want to provide light-portal services to customers from the cloud. And allow the customer to pay by the [taiji-chain](https://github.com/taiji-chain) currency. In order to attract more contributors, we will pay the contributors with the cryptocurrency as company share. They can use currency to access the services or sell them to other users. 

### Motivation

As we are a small company without any financial sponsor to support the development, we need a lot of community contribution to keep us ahead of other offerings from the market. The cryptocurrency is kind of company share that we can pay to the contributors, and then they can keep the currency or sell to other users.

### Unresolved questions

For the light-portal user management, are we using the current user management service or just switch to the blockchain to manage the user? 

With blockchain to manage the user, we can charge the fee for the service access on a request basis easily. With normal user management, we need to have a way to manage the account balance of the customer and charge them on a monthly basis.
