### Why this repository

A lot of developers expressed their interests in helping us to enhance the
light platform but they don't know where to start. There are too many repos
in networknt organization and repositories are inter-related. Bofore understand
the big picture, it is very hard for them to dive into one project to contribute.

This light-rfcs will consolidate all the urgent issues what we need to resolve
in our road map and we will document to the detail on implementation direction
so that developers won't need to understand all the moving part before working
on them. 

### Principle

We are following certain principles to build light platform and you can find it
at: 

https://doc.networknt.com/about/principles/


### Process

We welcome all developers to contribute and will work with you very closely.
For each item that we need to work on, we will create a rfc first so that we
can involve community for feedbacks and give people a clear picture of the
design. If would be much easier for new developers to pick up some items as
it clearly states what kind of skills are needed and what need to be done in
order to integrate with others. 

For each rfc item, once the discussion is completed, we will create an issue
in the right repository and assign to the developer(s) to work on it. 

### Support

For most of dicussions, we should use the github [issues](https://github.com/networknt/light-rfcs/issues) 
in this repo and some of the feedbacks will be written into the rfc when necessary. 

For generic questions, we can use [light-4j gitter](https://gitter.im/networknt/light-4j) 
account or each individual repository's gitter account to chat.

We also have a [sub reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/lightapi/) that can be 
used to discuss certain topics.
